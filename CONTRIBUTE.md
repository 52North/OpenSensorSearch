## Contributor License Agreement

52°North requires all contributors to sign a contributors license agreement (CLA). This is not scary but essential for open source projects to live beyond projects and individual contributions.

Find all information on our licensing page at <http://52north.org/about/licensing/> and our CLA FAQ at <http://52north.org/about/licensing/cla-guidelines>.

## Adding new features 

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* Before you start working on a new feature, create a new issue and start a discussion on the mailing list.
* We follow the fork & pull development model: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>
* Use the 52°North code style for Eclise: <https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome#Software_Development>
* Follow the OSS code guidelines: <https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/OssDevelopment#Development_Process>

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around 3 days.


# Bug triage

You can help report bugs by filing them here: <https://github.com/52North/OpenSensorSearch/issues>

* Don't forget to check the existing ones first and take a look at the mailing list guidelines - going through these steps makes it likely that you can fix the bug yourself: <http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/mailinglist-guidelines>
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if the bug is reproducible. Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce? 


# Documentation

All documentation is [in the 52°North wiki](https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/OpenSensorSearch), and a critical read as well as feedback are always welcome.

## Maintainer Documentation

Documentation for people who want to install and run their own OSS server can be found in the wiki. Just try installing and configuring the software on your system based on the tutorials in the Wiki, let us know what works and what does not, or just go ahead and fix the documentation yourself:

* Installation tutorial: <https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/OssInstallation>
* Configuration: <https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/OssConfiguration>

## User Documentation

People who just "use" OSS might need help in using the variety of features. Help is very welcome by exending the user documentation wiki page and also as feedback on the design and structure of the website.

* User documentation: [to be added...]


# Community 

You can help us making OSS more useful for you by writing your requirements as a [user story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) in the form *"As a MY_ROLE, I want MY_GOAL_OR_DESIRE so that A_BENEFIT"* and add it as an issue tagged ["user story"](https://github.com/52North/OpenSensorSearch/issues?labels=user+story) here: <https://github.com/52North/OpenSensorSearch/issues>

Tell us about how you use OSS on the community mailing list: <http://sensorweb.forum.52north.org/>
