Integration Test Module for SIR binding
=======================================

This Open Sensor Search module contains all integration tests, i.e. tests that are not testing a specific unit/class but rely on the interaction of several components and partly even require internet access, that test the Sensor Instance Registry (SIR) API.

Run the integration tests with Maven: ``mvn verify -Pintegration-test``
